# Team10Maze
Maze game created using Java for ENG1.

### To run:
cd into this directory and type "./gradlew run" -- if on windows: "./gradlew.bat run"

### Relative path for the game.java itself (the game is stored here)
#### core/src/main/java/com/Team10/Team10Maze/mazeGame.java
mazeGame.java is our main entrypoint to game.
Made it modular so can create classes for mainMenu, mazeMap1, etc.

### References and Notes
References to the creators of assets in assets/usedAssetReferences.md

** Overall notes on libGDX and how the game loop works (moreso for devs) is in libGDXNotes.md -- Starting of documentation


### TODO:
These are the current tasks in individual functions/ files we want to tackle next. Can be vague ideas but important to keep up-to-date on what we need to do so no double-coding can be done, wasting time.

- Maze creation -- Kamso creating what maze will look like then whoever is most comfortable converting that to code will do
    - Making tempMaze placeholder to get basic movement down for now -- Specific TODOs in map1Maze.java
- Low priority mainMenu.java : Have clickable button size resize with window (use getBackgroundSize() in resize())
