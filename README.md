<h2>Gantt Charts for Weekly Snapshots</h2>
<h3>End of Week 1</h3>
<img width="689" height="816" alt="end of week 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a49c37d-ae56-4daf-bd64-137cef93f0bc" />
<br>
At the end of week 1, we completed team building exercises. We decided to wait until we had the assessment document before beginning our project.

<h3>End of Week 2</h3>

<img width="689" height="816" alt="end of week 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3076b9aa-74a9-4295-9421-8cb87ccd87c6" />
<br>
At the end of week 2, we researched our chosen game engine and brainstormed our game’s design and idea. We allocated roles according to our skills and began working in small groups or individually on each part of the project. 


<h3>End of Week 3</h3>
<img width="689" height="877" alt="end of week 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c66cbf86-7524-4c7a-b06a-af6cd2461076" />
<br>
At the end of week 3, our software team made a simple UI for the main menu, as well as basic movement using a 2D array. They also implemented a timer, and created code logic for the powerup. 


<h3>End of Week 4</h3>
<img width="714" height="877" alt="end of week 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1685007-7bcb-4065-bba4-a29785df47de" />
<br>
At the end of week 4, we ran into technical issues and discovered we needed more time to complete the rest of the tasks. As a result, we extended our deadlines by a week.


<h3>End of Week 5</h3>
<img width="826" height="877" alt="end of week 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42796a0a-533a-450f-9112-80fa098bcfba" />
<br>
At the end of week 5, we converted to movement system from a 2D array to a library called GameTile. A playable test build was also developed, containing camera movement, a basic main menu and a basic map level.

<h3>End of Week 6</h3>
<img width="874" height="877" alt="end of week 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1a24aa2-2e92-4932-aad8-f23376e9c948" />
<br>
Week 6 was reading week, and we therefore made no progress in code.
