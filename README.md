** Overall notes on libGDX and how the game loop works (moreso for devs) is in libGDXNotes.md -- Starting of documentation


### TODO:
These are the current tasks in individual functions/ files we want to tackle next. Can be vague ideas but important to keep up-to-date on what we need to do so no double-coding can be done, wasting time.

- Currently implementing the main menu to be able to go into the game itself.
