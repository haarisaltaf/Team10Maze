# Team10Maze
Maze game created using Java for ENG1.

### To run:
cd into this directory and type "./gradlew run" -- if on windows: "./gradlew.bat run"

### Relative path for the game.java itself (the game is stored here)
#### core/src/main/java/com/Team10/Team10Maze/mazeGame.java
mazeGame.java is our main entrypoint to game.
Made it modular so can create classes for mainMenu, mazeMap1, etc.

### References and Notes
References to the creators of assets in assets/usedAssetReferences.md

** Overall notes on libGDX and how the game loop works (moreso for devs) is in libGDXNotes.md -- Starting of documentation


### TODO:
These are the current tasks in individual functions/ files we want to tackle next. Can be vague ideas but important to keep up-to-date on what we need to do so no double-coding can be done, wasting time.

- Maze creation -- Kamso creating what maze will look like then whoever is most comfortable converting that to code will do
    - Making tempMaze placeholder to get basic movement down for now -- Specific TODOs in map1Maze.java
- Low priority mainMenu.java : Have clickable button size resize with window (use getBackgroundSize() in resize())

At the end of week 1, we completed team building exercises. We decided to wait until we had the assessment document before beginning our project.

## End of Week 2
<img width="689" height="816" alt="end of week 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3076b9aa-74a9-4295-9421-8cb87ccd87c6" />
At the end of week 2, we researched our chosen game engine and brainstormed our game’s design and idea. We allocated roles according to our skills and began working in small groups or individually on each part of the project. 


## End of Week 3
<img width="689" height="877" alt="end of week 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c66cbf86-7524-4c7a-b06a-af6cd2461076" />
At the end of week 3, our software team made a simple UI for the main menu, as well as basic movement using a 2D array. They also implemented a timer, and created code logic for the powerup. 


## End of Week 4
<img width="714" height="877" alt="end of week 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1685007-7bcb-4065-bba4-a29785df47de" />
At the end of week 4, we ran into technical issues and discovered we needed more time to complete the rest of the tasks. As a result, we extended our deadlines by a week.


## End of Week 5
<img width="826" height="877" alt="end of week 5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42796a0a-533a-450f-9112-80fa098bcfba" />
At the end of week 5, we converted to movement system from a 2D array to a library called GameTile. A playable test build was also developed, containing camera movement, a basic main menu and a basic map level.

## End of Week 6
<img width="874" height="877" alt="end of week 6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1a24aa2-2e92-4932-aad8-f23376e9c948" />
Week 6 was reading week, and we therefore made no progress in code.
